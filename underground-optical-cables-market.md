<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Underground Optical Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multimode Fiber</li><li>Singlemode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The underground optical cables market primarily consists of two types: multimode fiber (MMF) and singlemode fiber (SMF). Multimode fiber features a larger core, allowing multiple light modes to transmit simultaneously, making it suitable for short-distance applications like data centers. In contrast, singlemode fiber has a smaller core that permits only one light mode, enabling long-distance communication with higher bandwidth and reduced signal loss. Both types are essential for enhancing connectivity in telecommunications and data transmission networks.</p></p>
