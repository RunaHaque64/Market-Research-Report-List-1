<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non Optical Magnetometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absolute Magnetometer</li><li>Relative Magnetometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-optical magnetometer market is divided into two main types: absolute magnetometers and relative magnetometers. Absolute magnetometers provide a direct measurement of the magnetic field strength, offering precise and independent readings, making them ideal for applications requiring high accuracy. In contrast, relative magnetometers measure changes in magnetic fields relative to a reference point, which is useful in applications like mineral exploration and navigation, where variations are more significant than absolute values. Both play crucial roles in geophysical studies and technological advancements.</p></p>
