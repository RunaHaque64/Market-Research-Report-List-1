<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Tractor Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agricultural tractor tyres market consists of two primary types: radial agriculture tires and bias (crossply) agriculture tires. Radial tires feature layers of fabric arranged perpendicularly to the direction of travel, providing increased flexibility, better traction, and improved fuel efficiency. In contrast, bias tires have layers that crisscross, offering a stiffer structure which can be beneficial for load-bearing but may result in reduced traction and fuel efficiency. Each type caters to specific farming needs, machinery compatibility, and operational conditions.</p></p>
