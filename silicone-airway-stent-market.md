<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicone Airway Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Covered</li><li>Partially Covered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The silicone airway stent market comprises two main types: fully covered and partially covered stents. Fully covered stents have a complete lining that prevents tissue ingrowth and reduces the risk of obstruction, making them ideal for prolonged use in obstructed airways. In contrast, partially covered stents feature a combination of covered and uncovered sections, allowing for some tissue integration while maintaining airway patency. This differentiation caters to varying clinical needs, enhancing patient outcomes in airway management.</p></p>
