<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Crash Cushions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-redirective Crash Cushions</li><li>Redirective Crash Cushions</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Crash cushions are safety devices designed to absorb the impact of vehicles in collisions, reducing damage and enhancing safety. Non-redirective crash cushions are designed to absorb energy without redirecting the impacting vehicle, minimizing the risk of secondary collisions. In contrast, redirective crash cushions manage the impact by directing the vehicle away from the hazard, helping to prevent secondary accidents. Both types are crucial in road safety, catering to different scenarios and placement requirements for optimal effectiveness.</p></p>
