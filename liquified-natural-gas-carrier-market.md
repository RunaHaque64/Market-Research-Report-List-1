<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquified Natural Gas Carrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-supporting Type</li><li>Film Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) carrier market includes two primary types: self-supporting and film-type carriers. Self-supporting type carriers feature independent tanks that can withstand significant pressure and maintain LNG at low temperatures, enhancing safety and efficiency. In contrast, film-type carriers utilize membrane technology, where thin layers line the ship's hull, allowing for efficient space utilization while minimizing LNG boil-off. Both types serve crucial roles in the transport of LNG, catering to different operational needs and market demands.</p></p>
